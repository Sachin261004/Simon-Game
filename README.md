# Simon-Game
The Simon game is an electronic memory challenge. It has four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. The game plays a sequence of lights and sounds. Your job is to remember and repeat that sequence.

Here's how it works: The game starts by lighting up one button. You press that button. Then the game adds another button to the sequence, and you have to copy the whole sequence in the same order. It gets longer each time you succeed.

If you make a mistake by pressing the wrong button or miss the sequence, the game ends. It's simple to understand but gets tougher as the sequences get longer.

It's a fun way to test and improve your memory and concentration skills. The longer you play, the more challenging it becomes!
